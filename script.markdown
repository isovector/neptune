WIDE SHOT OF OFFICE

The scene opens with Angelo at the front of a company-wide meeting. After some
brief opening comments, he informs the company that Chuck, the old CFO, has
passed away. Angelo doesn't want to give a speech, so he announces Colin will
say some words. This is news to Colin.


CLOSEUP ON THE EXECUTIVE PANEL

                              COLIN (to KIMBERLY)
    What? Shit. Angelo didn't mention this to me. I'm not prepared. Why does he
    always do this?

                                   KIMBERLY
    It was my idea. (she winks) Your speeches are always so moving.

                                     JAMES
    I think you'll do great, buddy!


Angelo comes over to Colin, pats him on the back.

                                     ANGELO
    Thanks, Colin. I know I can count on you.


Angelo goes to walk out the door.

                                     COLIN
    What? You're not even going to stick around for it?

                                     ANGELO
    I'd love to, Colin. Your speeches are always so moving, but... I've a tee
    time I don't want to miss. Thanks again.


[big dialogue tree here for putting together a speech off the top of your head.
it is clear that Chuck wasn't well liked, and there are lots of allusions to his
drinking problem and tight-grip over the finances]

The meeting concludes, and the office workers go out to lunch. They figure now
that Chuck is gone, the reimbursement policy will probably be laxer than usual.
The scene resets on the penthouse floor, with Colin returning to his office. He
passes Wendy, Angelo's assistant.

                                     WENDY
    Nice speech. I felt so moved.

                                     COLIN
    Thanks, Wendy.

                                     WENDY
    Hey, how's that report for the board members coming along? Angelo was pretty
    adamant about presenting it tomorrow morning.

                                     COLIN
    Oh? Yeah, yeah, it's coming along swimmingly.

                                     WENDY
    You haven't started it yet, have you?

    ----

                                     COLIN
    I used to be able to slip things past you. When did you get to be so astute?

                                     WENDY
    It's necessary to survive in this industry. I might just be a secretary, but
    the fact that Kimberly, James or you haven't managed to get me fired in any
    of your mad quests for power must mean something. Survival of the fittest, I
    guess?

                                     COLIN
    Oh come on. I love you! You're great, Wendy. I'd never get in your way, you
    know that. James, now, that guy is trouble.

                                     WENDY
    Whatever.

                                     WENDY
    You know, if you can't get that report done for tomorrow, you could always
    sucker some poor intern to do it for you. That's what Kim does.

                                     COLIN
    And pervert the sanctity of my honest work ethic and can-do attitude? What
    do you take me for, Wendy?

    ----

                                     COLIN
    Hey uhh, know if we have any new interns?

                                     WENDY
    You mean ones who weren't here for the Christmas party?

                                     COLIN
    Yeah, like ones who weren't here for the Christmas party.

                                     WENDY
    There's a new guy -- I think he started last week. His name is Simon if I
    remember correctly. Fresh blood; straight out of college. I think he works
    down in the finance room.

                                     WENDY
    If you get down there soon enough, maybe James won't get a chance to get his
    claws in him first.

Down the hallway is the doors to KIMBERLY's and JAMES' offices.

[reiterate that we need to talk to the intern and convince him to write the
report for us. unfortunately when we meet him, he says his boss has him on this
super important project. we must convince the boss.]
